## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

In this component, I focused on making the FAQ interactive using React state management. Here are the key takeaways:

*Dynamic Rendering with .map()*
Instead of repeating HTML structure for each FAQ item, I stored the data in an array of objects. This makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
  - 
```js
{faqData.map((item) => (
  <article key={item.id} className="faq_area">
    {/* ... */}
  </article>
))}
```

*Stateful Accordion Logic*
I learned how to use the useState hook to track which item is currently open. By storing the id of the active item (or null when all are closed), I ensured that only one question is expanded at a time.

*Conditional Rendering for Assets*
I practiced using the ternary operator to switch between plus and minus icons dynamically. I also learned that in a React environment (using Vite), images in the src folder should be imported as modules for proper bundling.

```js
<span className="faq_icon">
  {openId === item.id ? <img src={iconMinus} alt="" /> : <img src={iconPlus} alt="" />}
</span>
```

*Semantic HTML with <article>*
I used the <article> tag to wrap each question and answer pair, which improves the document structure and accessibility for screen readers.

```js
<article key={item.id} className="faq_area">
    <button type='button' className="faq_button"
    onClick={() => handleToggle(item.id)}>
        <h2 className="faq_title">{item.title}</h2>
        <span className="faq_icon">
            {openId === item.id 
                ? <img src={iconPlus} alt="plus" /> 
                : <img src={iconMinus} alt="minus"/>
            }
        </span>
    </button>

    {openId === item.id && (
        <p className="faq_answer">{item.answer}</p>
    )}
</article>
```
